ðŸ§© Problem Description (English)
Title: Check if All Points Lie on the Border of a Square

Task:
You are given two integer arrays X and Y, both of length N (1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 20), representing the coordinates of N distinct points on a 2D plane. Your task is to determine whether all given points lie exactly on the border of some axis-aligned square (i.e., a square whose sides are parallel to the X and Y axes).

You may assume that:

Points may lie on any of the four sides of the square (top, bottom, left, or right), including corners.

The square's position and size are not given â€” you must check whether such a square can be constructed based on the point set.

ðŸ§® Input
X: a list of integers, where X[i] is the x-coordinate of the i-th point.

Y: a list of integers, where Y[i] is the y-coordinate of the i-th point.

Constraints:

1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 20

-10 â‰¤ X[i], Y[i] â‰¤ 10

All points are distinct

ðŸŽ¯ Output
Return True if all points lie on the border of some axis-aligned square.

Return False otherwise.
