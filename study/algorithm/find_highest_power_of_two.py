'''
A positive integer N is given. The goal is to find the highest power of 2 that divides N. In other words, we have to find the maximum K for which N modulo 2^K is 0.

For example, given integer N = 24 the answer is 3, because 2^3 = 8 is the highest power of 2 that divides N.

Write a function:

def solution(N)

that, given a positive integer N, returns the highest power of 2 that divides N.

For example, given integer N = 24, the function should return 3, as explained above.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

def solution(N):
   
    highest_power = 0
    while N % 2 == 0:
        N = N // 2
        highest_power += 1

    return highest_power
